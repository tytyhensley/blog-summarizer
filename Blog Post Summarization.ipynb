       "' The GameStop squeeze on short-sellers is an extraordinary event in markets, where at face value, retail traders and investors have worked together in an attempt to put some of the largest wall street institutions out of business . The broking firm of most of the retail side of this warfare ‘RobinHood’ is stealing from its poor, retail investors to give to its rich, capital backers .  Victor Niederhoffer is one of the most successful people alive today . He blew his hedge fund up in 1997 in a highly statistically improbable event, in which he sold puts that were targeted by market mechanics, rather than ‘truth’ The market is more leveraged, more volatile, more aggressive, better for types of trading and worse for investing .  Greenspans moral hazard of late 1994/1995 changed the market in a new way . Extraordinary people who were never wrong in risk-adjusted terms were carried out of them horizontally by players with leverage . Financial markets were now more poker – positioning, position size and leverage – and less fundamental – what are the future cash-flows of this business?   Does this matter?  In 1998, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) busted during the 1998 Russian financial crises, losing up to $4.6 billion USD in face value of an approximately $1 billion USD fund . LTCM was founded by a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers (of legendary fame in bonds) and their board included Myron S.   Scholes and Robert C. Merton of Black-Scholes fame, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 .  The big-picture thinkers who understand macro-level knowledge in a unique and sophisticated form give way to aggressive, predatory, leveraged, profit taking machinery . The result had been written in, in 1995-2008 was one epoch . The politically connected were able to exploit event risk, with insider knowledge providing superior returns . Now in 2021 we have a new epoch: Game Stop .  The market leverage, volatility, aggression and instability that saw Victor Niederhoffer lose his fund has been normalised . There are no fundamentals. Profit is a motive, but is almost a second tier motive . There is little fear of experiencing losses, and they are interested in punitively claiming a moral victory while using the systems logic against it .  The global financial system may simply not survive this total moral failure of making it so plainly clear that two sets of rules exist, with this contradiction exposed at a very vulnerable time .  Victor is now 77 years old, with, as we described, many of those years spent in battle with the house, battling the Fed, battling trophic levels in which LTCM is bailed out and he goes under . He has 5 health procedures scheduled for tomorrow culminating in the draining of his left leg which is bigger than Game Stop rise .'"

       "\" This is for those people who want to take time off to gain a better understanding of who they are and what they care about . This is not for those taking a break solely to relax or for professors who are on real sabbaticals — though you’re welcome to read it and see if anything applies . Make sure you have the resources to take a sabbatical . Give yourself that first month to have fun .  Hiking 300 miles of the PCT was that “something new and fun” for me . Backpacking day in and day out forced me to forget about work and slow down.  Life became simpler.  Job titles, promotions, and publications didn’t matter .  When you’re trying to figure out what you care about, you need to give yourself the space to explore . Only when you get a better idea of what gives you energy can you begin to more carefully lay down a plan and set goals . With so many paths to check out, it can feel overwhelming to keep trying new things .  What do you need to feel good in your day? Do you need people to converse with?  Morning exercise?  Coffee shop vibes?  An online group?  Fellow sabbatical friends?  No technology time?  A platform to share your work?   A (flexible and not self-worth defining) goal to work toward?  We forget that things take time, and we can't move fast enough to get to where we want to be . During my sabbatical, I would often look up people that I admired and learn their backstory to remind myself that most of the time, it takes people years to reach where they are . One unexpected conversation could change everything .  Coaching was initially a hard pill to swallow, especially because I’d never spent money on my mental health before . I was lucky enough to have two very understanding coaches who gave me the opportunity to experience coaching at a discounted rate while I worked through that mental block . After many monthly coaching sessions, I can say with confidence that coaching was integral to my emotional growth . Another option is to continue your job, but spend outside time working on whatever it is you'd want to explore .\""
